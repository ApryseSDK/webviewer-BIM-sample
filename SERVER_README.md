## Setting up Server

### Docker Image

1. Install [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. Pull latest webviewer bim server image:

```bash
docker pull pdftron/webviewer-bim-server:latest
```

## Configuring Server

The 3D server supports both setting configuration through a `config` file and setting it directly
through environment variables. To set configuration through a config file take the following steps:

The configuration file is a JSON file with the following options:

- `license` - The server license key
- `temp_directory` - The temp directory to use for processing. Defaults to `./sys/tmp`
- `log_directory` - The log directory to use for server logs. Defaults to `./sys/logs`
- `data_directory` - The directory to store cached data in. Defaults to `./sys/data`
- `log_level`     - Sets the logging level. Accepts `DEBUG` `INFO` `TRACE` `WARN`
- `num_threads`    - The number of concurrent jobs to target. Defaults to number of CPUs detected minus 1.
- `bind_address`   - The server binding address. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`
- `port`          - The server port. Defaults to `8085`
- `max_cache_size`  - The maximum cache size before forcing cache deletion. Defaults to 90% of the available disk.
- `force_zero_cache`- Force cache to constantly be removed. Defaults to `false`
- `release_mode`   - Sets HTTP to release mode, defaults to `true`.
- `request_timeout` - Maximum time to wait for an HTTP request result in seconds. Defaults to `10` seconds.
- `job_timeout`     - Maximum time to wait for a job to complete . Defaults to `10` minutes.
- `use_https`       - If `true`, enables HTTPS and uses the HTTPSPort. Defaults to `false`
- `https_port`      - HTTPS port, defaults to `443`
- `https_cert_file`  - The HTTPS public certificate location.
- `https_key_file`   - The HTTPS private certificate location.
- `allowed_origins` - The origins allowed to access the server. Expects a string array `['test.com','pdftron.com']`
 
 A sample of what the json file should look like.
 ```
{
    "license": "my_license_key",
    "allowed_origins": ["test.com", "pdftron.com"],
    "request_timeout": 1
}
 ```

 In order to pass these arguments as enviroment variables, just run the docker contianer with variable with the prefix `trn_`, such as:
```bash
docker run -e trn_license="MYLICENSE" -p 8085:8085 webviewer-bim-server
```

## Running Server

### Running with Docker and configuration file

```bash
docker run -p 8085:8085 -v ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_CONFIG_JSON_FILE:/home/docjob/config webviewer-bim-server
```

This will mount the config file to the container into the path `/home/docjob/config` where it will be
loaded from.

### Running with Docker and environment variables

```bash
docker run -p 8085:8085 -e trn_license="my_license_key" webviewer-bim-server
```

This will run the container with the configuration variable `trn_license` defined.

## Managing Docker 

It's important to maintain uptime when using a docker container. The best way to do this is with a container management tool such as `Portainer`, `Kubernetes`, `OpenShift`, `Docker`, `ECS` and much more.

When managing your webviewer-bim-server container, you can use its built in [health API](SERVER_README.md#response-body-2) to monitor its status.
